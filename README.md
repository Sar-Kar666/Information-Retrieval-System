# Information-Retrieval-System using RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION 
 As we know, Large Language Models like GPT have shown impressive capabilities in generating human-like text. However, 
they are often limited by the information they were trained on, which can become outdated or insufficient for certain tasks. 
This is where RAG comes in.

 Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a powerful technique that enhances the performance of LLMs by combining them 
with external knowledge sources. Instead of relying solely on the model's internal memory, RAG retrieves relevant 
information from a document store or database in real time and uses it to generate more accurate, up-to-date, and 
contextually relevant responses.
